# repo-crypt
## [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt)
`git-crypt init `the reop to crypt.
.gitattributes to specify file to crypt.
```
secretfile filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
*.key filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
.gitattributes !filter !diff
```
secretfile/*.key is the file pattern.
".gitattributes !filter !diff" means this .gitattributes should not be locked.

when the file to be locked is in the sub-folder,
should put the .gitattributes in the same  sub-folder which is like the git-crypt.

propose to use the key generated by git-crypt and stored in the other folder.
```
git-crypt export-key /path/to/keyfile
as example git-crypt export-key git-crypt-key/keyfile
```

and then should use the 
```
git-crypt unlock /path/to/keyfile 
as example: git-crypt unlock git-crypt-key/keyfile
```
but i don't know how to use special key to encrypt each file.

the file will be automatically encrypted after git push to repo.
